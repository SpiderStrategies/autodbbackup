Install Instructions
====================

1. Download and install Perl.  On windows, I used strawberry perl from the url [http://strawberryperl.com/](http://strawberryperl.com/).

2. Add required archives.

		perl -MCPAN -e "install Config::Properties"
		perl -MCPAN -e "install XML::LibXML" (on ubuntu systems: sudo apt-get install libxml-libxml-perl)
		perl -MCPAN -e "install List::MoreUtils"
		perl -MCPAN -e "install Net::SMTP_auth"
		perl -MCPAN -e "install Net::Amazon::S3"
		on ubuntu systems: sudo apt-get install libarchive-zip-perl

3. If Windows: To your classpath, add (whatever this location is on your machine):

	C:\strawberry\perl\site\lib\auto\XML\LibXML

4. Configure the properties file, config.properties
	* Set the db user name and password
	* Set the s3 id, password, bucket name
	* Set the uploaded file prefix (s3keyprefix). This is essentially the "directory" the backup will be in.  This must end with a front slash (/).
	* Set the databases to back up as a comma separated list (no spaces)
	* Set the location to be used for the sql files (outputlocation). Even on windows systems you should use front slashes (/) in the path.
	* Set the email server information so that you can be notified of the backups.  If you don't want notifications, remove the "to" email address from the configuration.
    * Set the directoriesToBackup to a comma separated list of the directories to zip and backup to s3.  Even on windows systems you should use front slashes (/) in the path.  Leave blank if no directories are to be backed up.

5. The backup script can be invoked without a configuration file or invoked with the single argument of the configuration file to use.  Invoke like:
    perl backupdbs.pl
    or
    perl backupdbs.pl /path/to/config.properties
    or
    perl backupdbs.pl c:/path/to/config.properties
	  
6. Configure your machine to invoke the backupdbs.pl regularly.  On a Windows system:
	1. Right click on "My Computer", click "Manage".
	2. Click Task Scheduler
	3. Click Create Basic Task from the right-hand pane
	4. Set the name (perhaps Backup Database).  Click next.
	5. Choose your frequency.  Click next.
	6. Set the time.  Click next.
	7. Start a program should be selected.  Click next.
	8. Set the program to be (or whatever your perl executable is): C:\strawberry\perl\bin\perl.exe
	9. Set your arguments to be: backupdbs.pl config.properties
	10. Set your starting location to be the directory of that perl script, like: C:\Users\Dan Kolz\git\autodbbackup_repo\autodbbackup\scripts
	11. Click next.
	12. Click finish.
